# Deep-Learning--Sketch-to-image-using-GANs

A Deep learning project using PyTorch that translates a sketch(black and white) image to a colored image using PyTorch.

Get Started
To run the project -

Download the dataset 'AnimeSketchColorizationPair' from Kaggle and store it on a drive.
Run 'sketch_to_image_final.ipynb' on local environment(if powerful GPU is available) or on Google Colab using T4. It took me 11 Hours and 58 minutes for 68 epochs.
Get the saved model 'state_dict.pt' and make some changes in the app.py accordingly.
Run 'app.py'.
